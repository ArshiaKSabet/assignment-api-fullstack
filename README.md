# API Fullstack Code Case

**NOTE** This is a very simple application, I frankly don't remember if there was more to it or not. Visualwise, this could be done alot better, but I chose simplicity here just to show that I am capable.

## Installation

To install this project, start by running `npm install` in the root directory. This will install all of the necessary dependencies for the project.

Next, you'll need to set up the server. Navigate to the server directory and run npm start. Console should state: "Server listening on port 3001".

Next, to run the app, simply run `npm run dev` in the root directory. This will start the app and allow you to view it in your web browser.

## Usage



If both the server and the frontend-application is live, you can open the webpage with the correct adress (should be: http://localhost:5173/). You should be able to see the category tree rendered out, clicking on of the categories/subcategories should redirect you to the specific category page where the next children(if there are any) should be rendered out again.
